            <p></p>
            <p>There ain't no gold in this river<br>
            That I've been washing my hands in forever<br>
            I know there is hope in these waters<br>
            But I can't bring myself to swim<br>
            When I am drowning in this silence<br>
             <p class="intense">Baby, let me in</p> 
            
            <p class="highlight">Go easy on me, baby!</p>
            
            I was still a child<br>
            Didn't get the chance to<br>
            <p class="intense">Feel the world around me</p> 
             I had no time to choose what I chose to do <br>
            
            <p class="highlight"> So, go easy on me </p>

            There ain't no room for our things to change<br>
            When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways<br>
            You can't deny how hard I have tried<br>
            I changed who I was to put you both first<br>
            <p class="intense">But, now, I give up</p> 
           
            <p class="highlight"> Go easy on me,baby! </p>
                       
            
            I was still a child<br>
            Didn't get the chance to<br>
            <p class="intense">Feel the world around me</p>
            Had no time to choose what I chose to do<br>

            <p class="highlight"> So, go easy on me </p>
                      
            
            I had good intentions<br>
            And the highest hopes<br>
            But I know right now<br>
            <p class="intense">It probably doesn't even show</p>
    
            <p class="highlight"> Go easy on me,baby! </p>

                        
            <br>
            I was still a child<br>
            I didn't get the chance to<br>
            <p class="intense">Feel the world around me</p> 
           
            I had no time to choose what I chose to do<br>
       
            <p class="highlight"> So, go easy on me </p>
